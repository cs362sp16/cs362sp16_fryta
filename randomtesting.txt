Coverage seems to improve slightly over the unittesting alone, granted my unit testing was a lot more thorough.
The code is already pretty broken, given the number of segfaults that occur.
The main thing I did was specifically add an incorrect increment of a value to trigger my adventurer check.

I am hitting 21.13% lines of coverage from the test I have ran. My mine coverage is 100% and doesn't take very long to run.
This is because the mine function itself is pretty simplistic.
My unit tests in general are more advance, but that is because they are larger and more robust.
I think my random tests could be more expansive, but the number of segfaults really hinders the ability. 

Unit tests were better in my case, but if we consider segfaults faults then random is better at actually finding things.
