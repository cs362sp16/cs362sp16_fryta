Refactored Functions:
council_room
mine
remodel
smithy
village

Discussion: Effectively what I did is create either void or int functions for each function I refactored out (depending on if we needed to change the return value). 
I then moved all of the logic out of the switch statement and into the new code and passed in all the needed function parameters. 
I purposely did this in a lazy fashion as the code itself is trash and will need heavy refactoring to work correctly. 
Also I added two bugs by doing simple things to either the same code or the new code.

Two bugs have been added.













































Added bug in council_room_func for loop escapes one too late.
Mine is just bugged, added bad initialization
