I used a mutation tool found at https://github.com/arun-babu/mutate.py

It was pretty simple to use and worked well at making minor mutations to the dominion.c file.
My testdominion with seed 42 was decent at catching bugs changed by the mutation. However there were certain bugs it failed to find.
One example is a multiply by zero change made to my supply count of copper. Because my implementation doesn't check for the coin
amounts on startup it never caught that we had zer 0 copper to start with in the game.
