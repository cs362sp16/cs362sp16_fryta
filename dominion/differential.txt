Assignment 4

Results:
After running a comparison of my (much less fixed) dominion compared to Trevor Hammock's
I have determined that his is extremely clean a bug free compared to the partial repaired
mess that is my dominion code. The biggest problem was fixing a very annoying segfault
in my implementation that kept the testdominion.c file from running all the way through.

At the end of the day I think the best method to test the program is side by side playing
a real game in the same order and tracking that both games have the same counts and scores
as the game is being played. Also would require someone checking for human error though.

With multiple runs my test coverages reaches 60%, the range of runs required seems to
differ quite a bit when testing. I sometimes hit the coverage amount within 8, others
would take up to 25. Trevor's was even better getting to the coverage point on a single
run when using the seed 100!
